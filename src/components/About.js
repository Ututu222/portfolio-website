      <h4>A Little About Me:</h4>
      <p>
        I am an avid problem-solver and enjoy finding the most efficient
        solution. Refining code I have written to use as few lines as possible
        and work more efficiently is very satisfying. I am fascinated by how
        things work behind the scenes, both for people and for tech. Finding out
        people's experiences, values and beliefs helps me understand where they
        come from and what makes them tick.
      </p>

        I am a quick learner and enjoy familiarizing myself with new
        technologies. I am an agreeable person by nature; I get along with
        almost everyone I meet. I am honest and hard-working, although I can be
        somewhat reserved with people I am not comfortable with yet. I am
        equally comfortable quietly working on something by myself or in tandem
        with a tight-knit team of passionate people. Remaining adaptable and
        open to new solutions/experiences is valuable to me.
