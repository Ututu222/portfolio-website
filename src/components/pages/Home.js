          I'm a software developer currently based in Edmonton, Alberta. I am
          currently open to relocating, though.

          After nearly a decade of working in the food industry as a line cook,
          I decided to go back to school and switch careers into something I was
          more passionate about. Developing software solutions to modern
          problems is pretty fun! I strive to be a lifelong learner in most all
          aspects of my life, so software development seemed like a great fit.

          The main purpose of this website is to practice my web development
          skills. It is built using React. I used the "Create React App" tool to
          streamline the process. I implemented Bootstrap to help with styling
          as well.
